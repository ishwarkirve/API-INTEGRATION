**DESCRIPTION** :

API Integration Using Web Page
This repository contains a comprehensive project that demonstrates how to integrate APIs into a web page to build dynamic, data-driven user interfaces. It provides a foundational framework for developers to connect their web applications with external services or internal APIs. The primary focus of this project is to enable seamless interaction between the web page and the API for fetching, displaying, and managing data.

Overview
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are integral to modern web applications, serving as the backbone for data exchange between the client and server. This project focuses on creating a fully functional web page that interacts with APIs using industry-standard protocols like REST (Representational State Transfer) or GraphQL.

The web page is designed to send requests to an API, handle the responses effectively, and present the data in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, it includes provisions for handling authentication, error management, and configuration of API endpoints, making it a versatile starting point for various projects.
